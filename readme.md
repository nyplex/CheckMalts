## User's needs

<!-- My main focus regarding the user's needs was the application layout design and responsivity. My second focus was to add some friendly and usefull feature (comments images, tags etc.)
 
Finally I wanted to make sure the application was easy to use and for that I've decided to use a minimalistic design with short and direct text. -->

The main focus regarding the user's needs was to give the user a very simple and short way to order online. The second main focus was to have a stunning design and a layout to represent the company's culture. I wanted to application to aslso be friendly and interactive.
